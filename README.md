# Youtube-View-Bot

I have made a simple YouTube view bot using Python. Not every view counts because of how YouTube works. I ran it for a few minutes and got over 50 views.

Instructions: 

Put the view bot file into documents (In File Explorer)



Visual Studio Code Instructions:

1. Install or Open Visual Studio Code - https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Go to the extensions on the marketplace (2nd Last button on left side bar)
3. Type in Python, click on it, install it
4. Drag bot.py into visual studio, do not close visual studio


Every time you run the code you need visual studio and chromedriver.exe opened. I have the chromedrive.exe file in the folder but if it does not work
go to https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/ and download the correct version. Once opened follow instructions on the terminal.


Python setup:

1. Press the windows key
2. Type cmd and Command Prompt should pop up. 
3. Open Command Prompt and type Python
4. It should take you to microsoft store to download the ability to run python

How to Run the Script

1. Have visual studio with bot.py opened
2. Have chromedriver.exe opened
3. Have Command Prompt opened
4. Have a link of the youtube video you want botted -- paste the link inbetween ''
5. Pick how many views you want (not 100% accurate) -- follow instructions on bot.py
6. Pick how many seconds until refresh -- follow instructions on bot.py
7. Go to File Explorer and right click on bot.py , check the path it should be something like C:\users\ and other locations. 
8. Once you have the file location go to command prompt and type cd and paste the file path for bot.py next to it
9. Then type python bot.py a chrome window should pop up with the youtube video you picked and it should refresh
